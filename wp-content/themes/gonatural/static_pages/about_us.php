                We just love every little furry thing about them; from when they’re tiny and helpless, as they settle down
                into our hearts and homes and daily lives, to when they’re older and in need of extra care.
                Dogs and cats and cats and dogs. They keep us company, warm our hearts and make us laugh and laugh. And, if
                you’re like us, you do the very best you can for your pets; all that you can to keep them healthy, safe,
                active and happy.

            <p>
                At Petcurean, we create premium quality, nutrient-rich food that’s right for pets, to help our dogs and cats
                get the most out of their lives with us. We always have, since day one when two good friends started a
                little family operation in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada.

                They were driven by the idea that pets deserved better: that pets deserved food that was made with the same
                love and care as we put into preparing meals for our own families.

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                To this day, Petcurean remains fiercely independent and lives by the rule of quality first, pets first,

                We’re pet people, pet owners, pet advocates and yes, more than a little obsessed with proper pet nutrition.
                You should see us when we’re talking about what recipes we should be creating; the meats, veggies and fruits
                we should be including; which rancher, farmer or producer we’ll source from; what flavours we should be
                considering.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not enough to create a new recipe for the sake of having a new recipe; our foods have to do better than
                that, our foods have to help pets stay healthy and happy. Think about it; one small piece of kibble contains
                every ingredient… the proteins, carbs and fats, the vitamins and minerals your pet needs to sustain and
                nourish its life.
            </p>
            <p class="about-accent-txt">
                Yup. With every decision we make, every recipe we create, we put pets first. That’s what we’ve always done,
                here at Petcurean. And, that’s what we’ll always do.
