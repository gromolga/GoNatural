                    Route 66 Adoption Tour
                    Various Locations
                    Petcurean is honoured to be once again sponsoring FIDO Friendly’s 9th Annual Get Your Licks on Route
                    66 Pet Adoption Tour. This is the third consecutive year Petcurean is partnering with FIDO Friendly
                    to place pets with their forever families.
                    The cross-country pet adoption tour officially kicked off on September 8th in Culver City,
                    California at the Riverside Animal Services and runs until October 15 with the final event in
                    Merriam, Kansas. Along the way, FIDO Friendly will be making stops to support and promote adoption
                    at local shelters.
